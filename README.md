# TutorialPreviewWithMockData
This sample tutorial app highlights Xcode preview integration with mock data. Introduced a simple mockable protocol that can be adopted by any struct or class, allowing you to create mockable objects. Mock JSON data is stored in developer assets, ensuring minimal impact on app size and making it accessible exclusively in the debug configuration.
